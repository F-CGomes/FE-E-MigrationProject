# Does giving information about the labor market and the immigrant’s education level affect the perceived skills transferability?

## Hypotheses

- Giving information on the German labor market, together with the immigrants’ education level, will positively affect the perceived skills
transferability.
- When only information about the migrants’ education level is given, then the effect on the perceived skills transferability could be zero or slightly positive, due to the common finding in the literature that the students’ attitude towards migrants tends to be more positive than of the general population.
- However, when the two types of information are given, there will be a positive response towards the arrival of migrants, since it will be known by individuals that there is room for them in the labor market.

## Conclusions
- Information about the German labor market and migrants' education level doesn’t increase the perceived skills transferability of migrants in a student population. Therefore, our main hypothesis doesn’t sustain.
- However, there is a significant negative effect when given information considering labor market variables as outcomes, with a slight difference between T1 and T2 being the last strong, as expected considering our other hypothesis. That stated that the two types of information would have a stronger effect.
- The results are consistent with the literature review, regarding that a highly educated population ( students ) are less likely to be affected by information regarding immigrants especially because they have a positive attitude towards migrants than the general population.
